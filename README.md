# multi-bookdown

This is a minimal multi-bookdown example.

The idea of a multi-bookdown template came from my work colleagues. After exploring several file structures, I came up with the structure presented in this repository. 

One advantage of the multi-bookdown file structure is that multiple bookdown projects can access Rmd/md files stored together in a separate folder outside each bookdown project folder.

Another advantage of this example is that it truly contains the minimal number of files that are required to render a bookdown.

Hope this helps!

Sincerely,

This repository is the result of several hours spent playing with bookdown after exploring the following documents:
* Yihui Xie's book [bookdown: Authoring Books and Technical Documents with R Markdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/acknowledgments.html) 
* Sean Kross's post on [How to Start a Bookdown Book](http://seankross.com/2016/11/17/How-to-Start-a-Bookdown-Book.html)
