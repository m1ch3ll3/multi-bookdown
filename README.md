# multi-bookdown

This is a minimal multi-bookdown example.

The idea of a multi-bookdown template came from my work colleagues. After exploring several file structures, I came up with the structure presented in this repository. 

One advantage of the multi-bookdown file structure is that multiple bookdown projects can access Rmd/md files stored together in a separate folder outside each bookdown project folder.

Another advantage of this example is that it truly contains the minimal number of files that are required to render a bookdown.

Hope this helps!

Sincerely,
